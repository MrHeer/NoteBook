\section{Throwing two eggs from a building}

\subsection*{Question}
Consider the previous question, but now
suppose you only have two eggs, and your cost model is the number of throws. Devise
a strategy to determine $F$ such that the number of throws is at most $2\sqrt{N}$, then find a
way to reduce the cost to $\sim c\sqrt{F}$. This is analogous to a situation where search hits (egg
intact) are much cheaper than misses (egg broken).

\subsection*{Answer}
Let us make our first attempt on $k$'th floor.
If it breaks, we try remaining $(k-1)$ floors one by one. 
So in worst case, we make $k$ trials.
If it doesnâ€™t break, we jump $(k-1)$ floors (Because we have
already made one attempt and we don't want to go beyond 
$k$ attempts. Therefore $(k-1)$ attempts are available),
Next floor we try is floor $k + (k-1)$
Similarly, if this drop does not break, next need to jump 
up to floor $k + (k-1) + (k-2)$, then $k + (k-1) + (k-2) + (k-3)$
and so on.
Since the last floor to be tried is $F$'th floor, sum of
series should be $F$ for optimal value of $k$.
\[k + (k-1) + (k-2) + (k-3) + \cdots + 1 \geqslant F\]
\[\frac{k(k+1)}{2} \geqslant F\]
\[k \geqslant \frac{\sqrt{8F+1}-1}{2}\]
\[k_{\min} = \lceil \frac{\sqrt{8F+1}-1}{2} \rceil \sim \sqrt{2F}\] 

\subsection*{Official solution}
Solution to Part 1: To achieve $2\sqrt{N}$, drop eggs at floors $\sqrt{N}$,
$2*\sqrt{N}$, $3*\sqrt{N}$, \ldots, $\sqrt{N}\sqrt{N}$. (For simplicity, we assume
here that $\sqrt{N}$ is an integer.) Let assume that the egg broke at level
$k\sqrt{N}$. With the second egg you should then perform a linear search in the
interval $(k-1)\sqrt{N}$ to $k\sqrt{N}$. In total you will be able to find the
floor $F$ in at most $2\sqrt{N}$ trials.\\
Hint for Part 2: $1 + 2 + 3 + \cdots + k \sim \frac{1}{2}k^2 \geqslant F$.
