\section{Throwing eggs from a building}

\subsection*{Question}
Suppose that you have an $N$-story building and
plenty of eggs. Suppose also that an egg is broken if it is thrown off floor $F$ or higher,
and unhurt otherwise. First, devise a strategy to determine the value of $F$ such that the
number of broken eggs is $\sim\lg{N}$ when using $\sim\lg{N}$ throws, then find a way to reduce the
cost to $\sim2\lg{F}$.

\subsection*{Answer}
$\sim\lg{N}$: start at the middle, always cut search space in half $\rightarrow$ binary search.\\
$\sim2\lg{F}$: start at 1, next 2, 4, 8 (i.e., $2^i$), once the egg breaks after ($\sim$$\lg{F}$ steps)
do binary search in the smaller search space (range $<F$ and hence number of searches $<$ $\sim\lg{F}$)
$\rightarrow$ exponential search.
\[2^{\lceil \lg{F} \rceil - 1} < F \leqslant 2^{\lceil \lg{F} \rceil}\]
\[range = 2^{\lceil \lg{F} \rceil} - 2^{\lceil \lg{F} \rceil - 1}
= 2^{\lceil \lg{F} \rceil - 1} < 2^{\lg{F}} = F\]
\[range < F\]
