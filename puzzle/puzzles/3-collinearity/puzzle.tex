\section{3-collinearity}

\subsection*{Question}
Suppose that you have an algorithm that takes as input $N$ distinct
points in the plane and can return the number of triples that fall on the same line.
Show that you can use this algorithm to solve the 3-sum problem. Strong hint: Use
algebra to show that $(a, a^3)$, $(b, b^3)$, and $(c, c^3)$ are collinear if and only if $a + b + c = 0$.

\subsection*{Answer}
\begin{proof}
    $(a, a^3)$, $(b, b^3)$, and $(c, c^3)$ are collinear if and only if $a + b + c = 0$: \\
    We use a formulation of collinearity which equates gradients (assuming our points are distinct) 
    \[\frac{y_2-y_1}{x_2-x_1}=\frac{y_3-y_1}{x_3-x_1}\]
    This becomes
    \[\frac{b^3-a^3}{b-a}=\frac{c^3-a^3}{c-a}\]
    which leaves us with
    \[b^2+ab+a^2=c^2+ac+a^2\]
    so that
    \[b^2-c^2=a(c-b)\]
    $c \neq b$ so we have $a=-(b+c)$
    \[a+b+c=0\]
\end{proof}
