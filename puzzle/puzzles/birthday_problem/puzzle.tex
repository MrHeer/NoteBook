\section{Birthday problem [Unsolved]}

\subsection*{Question}
Write a program that takes an integer $N$ from the command
line and uses \mintinline{java}{StdRandom.uniform()} to generate a random sequence of integers
between 0 and $N-1$. Run experiments to validate the hypothesis that the number of
integers generated before the first repeated value is found is $\sim \sqrt{\frac{N}{2}\pi}$.

\subsection*{Answer}
We can use \mintinline{java}{BitSet.get(next)} to determine if $next$ appears.

\subsection*{Code}
\inputminted{java}{puzzles/birthday_problem/BirthdayProblem.java}
\begin{proof}
    the number of integers generated before the first repeated
    value is found is $\sim \sqrt{\frac{N}{2}\pi}$.
\end{proof}
